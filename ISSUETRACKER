This is the OpenNSA issue tracker :-)


General:
  Connection state layering problem (top state only updated on commands)
  Persistence for connections
  Cleanups (mostly in backends)
  Command line client (Jeroen and HTJ will have a fight-off about which to use :-) )
  More backends :-)


Argia backend:
  State scheduling to terminated does not work.
